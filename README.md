# Candlestick Pattern Identification with TA-Lib and Custom Formulas

This repository contains code and resources for identifying candlestick patterns using TA-Lib and custom-defined formulas. The provided Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to detect common patterns like Doji, Hammer, Morning Star, Engulfing, and Harami using both pre-built TA-Lib functions and custom logic.

## Features

- **TA-Lib Integration**: Use the powerful TA-Lib library to identify common candlestick patterns.
- **Custom Pattern Formulas**: Implement custom logic to detect patterns based on specific conditions, allowing for more tailored analysis.
- **Data Handling**: Process and visualize stock data to identify trends and patterns over selected time periods.
- **Pattern Highlighting**: Automatically highlight detected patterns for easy analysis.

## Installation

To run the notebook and use the code, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries.

## Usage

1. Load Stock Data
Load your stock data into a Pandas DataFrame. The notebook demonstrates using historical stock prices with columns like Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, etc.

2. Pattern Detection

### TA-Lib Patterns
Utilize TA-Lib's built-in functions to detect patterns like Doji, Engulfing, etc.

### Custom Patterns
Implement and apply custom formulas to detect specific patterns, such as a Hammer pattern under certain conditions.

## 3. Visualization
Visualize the results using Matplotlib to better understand where patterns occur in your data.

## 4. Analysis
Analyze the frequency and distribution of patterns to inform your trading strategies.
